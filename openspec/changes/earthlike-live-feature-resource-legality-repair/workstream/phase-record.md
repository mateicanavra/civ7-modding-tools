# Phase Record

## Phase

- Project: Swooper recovery
- Phase: feature/resource legality repair planning
- Owner: Product/Development DRA
- Branch/Graphite stack: `codex/swooper-feature-resource-legality-drain`
  stacked above `codex/swooper-studio-parity-proof-drain`
- Started: 2026-06-06
- Status: active. The adjacent-land resource class is classified and repaired
  in the repo-owned adapter/map-policy surface. Remaining feature/resource
  classes are linked but still pending source-authority classification.

## Objective

- Target movement: repair feature/resource parity and legality only where
  classified proof assigns ownership to repo code.
- Non-goals: no guessed tuning, no hand-authored official data.
- Done condition: classified rows are repaired or dispositioned and product
  acceptance rerun passes.

## Current State

- Single-writer handoff:
  - `codex/civ7-map-policy-final-surface-parity` remains the committed proof
    path layer at `70a22c815 docs(openspec): route parity proof deltas`.
  - This branch intentionally takes over only the downstream feature/resource
    legality classification lane from that clean parity state.
  - The branch switch itself is not a parity, acceptance, source-authority, or
    product-quality closure claim.
  - Product/tuning edits remain forbidden until concrete rows are classified to
    a repo-owned source authority.
- Activation evidence:
  `/tmp/civ7-recovery-proof/final-surface-parity/studio-run-in-game-mq20rbzr-1fhc.json`
  from request `studio-run-in-game-mq20rbzr-1fhc`, exact-authorship status
  `complete`, live readback `106x66`, seed `138503614`, omitted plots `0`,
  stable turn/game-hash identity, and unresolved links
  `surface.terrain.mismatch`, `surface.feature.mismatch`, and
  `surface.resource.mismatch`.
- Row evidence:
  `openspec/changes/earthlike-live-feature-resource-legality-repair/workstream/delta-classification-ledger.md`
  records the concrete feature rows, resource example rows, and resource pair
  classes extracted from the exact-authored proof artifact. The adjacent-land
  resource class is classified; remaining feature/resource classes stay
  `source-authority: pending`.
- Static surface diagnostics:
  `mods/mod-swooper-maps/src/dev/diagnostics/surface-delta-context.ts`
  cross-checks feature/resource deltas against local and live terrain/biome/
  feature surfaces using `@civ7/map-policy` static official-derived tables.
  Pre-repair finding: feature rows were all static surface-legal; local
  resource values were static-legal; `26` live resource values failed only
  `resource.adjacent-land`. Current repaired finding: feature and resource
  deltas have no static surface invalid rows under the narrow runtime-observed
  adjacent-land exception.
- Classification progress:
  the `26` live-only adjacent-land rows are now classified to repo-owned
  adapter/map-policy static resource legality, based on exact-authored
  `RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_V1` evidence (`placedCount:252`, `rejectedCount:0`,
  `mismatchCount:0`) and matching live full-grid resource count. This
  authorized and received a narrow policy/mock parity repair only; all other
  resource substitution/local-only classes and all feature rows remain pending.
- Repair progress:
  `@civ7/map-policy` now records the live-observed adjacent-land exception
  narrowly for `RESOURCE_DYES`, `RESOURCE_FISH`, `RESOURCE_PEARLS`,
  `RESOURCE_COWRIE`, and `RESOURCE_TURTLES`; `@civ7/adapter` mock resource
  legality and the Swooper diagnostic helper consume that shared policy.
- Verification progress:
  focused policy/adapter/diagnostic tests, package checks, affected Turbo
  build/check lanes, and strict OpenSpec validation pass for this integration
  slice. No fresh final-surface runtime verifier proof was produced on
  `codex/swooper-feature-resource-legality-drain`; task 3.1 remains open and
  the next full parity proof needs a fresh Studio Run in Game exact-authorship
  request.
- Protected paths: generated outputs, official resources, unrelated worktrees.
- Next action: run a fresh Studio Run in Game exact-authorship request, rerun
  final-surface parity against that request, then classify remaining
  feature/resource rows by source authority: official data, adapter/map-policy,
  MapGen planning/materialization, accepted engine materialization, or readback
  limitation. Terrain edge rows may enter this slice only if diagnostics prove
  shared materialization ownership.
- Stop condition: source authority is not known for any row outside the
  classified adjacent-land resource class.
