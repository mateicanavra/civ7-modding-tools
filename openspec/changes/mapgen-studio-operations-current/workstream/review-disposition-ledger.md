## Disposition Rules

- `accepted`: repair before dependent implementation or closure.
- `rejected`: record source evidence showing the finding does not apply.
- `invalidated`: record later source evidence that made the finding false.
- `user-decision`: record the user or authority decision that resolves the finding.
- `waived`: allowed only for P3/nonblocking findings; record risk, owner, and trigger.
- `deferred`: allowed only for P3/nonblocking findings; record destination, owner, and context.
- `accepted-repaired`: accepted material finding repaired inside this slice with
  evidence and no remaining closure block.

No material finding may remain undispositioned at phase closure.
