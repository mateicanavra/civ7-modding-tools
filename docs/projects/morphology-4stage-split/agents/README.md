# Agent Scratchpads

Each agent writes a scratchpad file here:
- `agent-A.md` — stage-id + config-key blast radius
- `agent-B.md` — Studio/viz coupling + label strategy
- `agent-C.md` — decision packets + migration slice proposal

## Format
- Prefer short sections.
- Every non-obvious claim must include a file path (and line number where practical).
- Avoid implementation. This folder is investigation + scoping only.
