# Decision Packets (If Needed)

Only add decision packets here when the spike uncovers real “this-or-this” architectural choices that need an explicit accept/reject outcome.

Prefer referencing canonical SPEC/policy docs rather than copying them.

Locked directives (do not open decision packets for these):
- Atomic per-feature ops (maximal modularity)
- Compute substrate (compute ops vs plan ops)
