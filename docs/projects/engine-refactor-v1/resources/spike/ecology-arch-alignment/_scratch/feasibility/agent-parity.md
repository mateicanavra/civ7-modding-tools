# Agent D: Parity + Determinism (Feasibility)

## Objective

Define feasibility-stage “no behavior change” parity expectations and how we will prove them later:
- invariants (ids, viz keys, tags/effects, determinism),
- which tests and diagnostics are sufficient gates,
- and where ordering/RNG sensitivity risks exist.

## Constraints / Guidance

- Do not propose production refactor code; produce a parity plan and risk register.
- Do not reindex Narsil MCP.

## Findings

TBD.
