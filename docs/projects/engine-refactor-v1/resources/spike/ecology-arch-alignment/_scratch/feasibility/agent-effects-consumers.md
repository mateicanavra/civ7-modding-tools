# Agent C: Tags/Effects + Downstream Gating (Feasibility)

## Objective

Make a recommendation for effect/tag modeling in Ecology projection/materialization, focused on:
- `plot-effects` adapter write boundary (effect guarantee vs no guarantee),
- namespace choice (`effect:engine.*` vs `effect:map.*`),
- downstream consumer scan (who would gate on it),
- and feasibility/risk.

## Constraints / Guidance

- Stay consistent with canonical MapGen posture: effects are boolean execution guarantees.
- Prefer canonical specs/policies/guidelines; do not use old ADRs as primary sources.
- Do not reindex Narsil MCP.

## Findings

TBD.
