# Phase 4 Scratch (Not Canonical)

This directory contains Phase 4 working notes and agent scratch pads.

- Treat these files as **non-canonical**.
- Implementation must follow the canonical plan surfaces:
  - `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/milestones/M2-ecology-architecture-alignment.md`
  - `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/issues/LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-*.md`
  - `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/resources/runbooks/HANDOFF-M2-ECOLOGY-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
