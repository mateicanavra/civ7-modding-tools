# Agent 2 Scratch: Milestone -> Local Issue Docs (M2)

Status: pending

## Deliverable Checklist
- Create local issue docs for `LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-001..016` under `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/issues/`.
- Refactor `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/milestones/M2-ecology-architecture-alignment.md` into an index linking to issue docs.
- Preserve nuance: no meaning changes; copy content faithfully.
- Convert any `**Prework Prompt (Agent Brief)**` blocks into `## Prework Prompt (Agent Brief)` sections in the issue docs.
- Run the link/dependency fixer script (read-only; `--write` only if needed).
- Provide a table of created/updated docs (paths) and note any deviations (expected none).
