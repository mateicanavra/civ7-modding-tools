# Agent 1 Scratch: Doc/Spec Alignment Review

Status: pending

## Deliverable Checklist
- Contradictions list (doc A vs doc B) with pointers + recommended SSOT.
- Superseded/outdated docs inventory with action per doc:
  - incorporate into M2/issues OR archive (with explicit “do not use” guidance).
- “Maximal greenfield + behavior-preserving” audit:
  - confirm `GREENFIELD.md` intent is fully represented in M2 issues.
  - flag any behavior-changing work that slipped in.
- Concrete edit list (exact files + exact change).
