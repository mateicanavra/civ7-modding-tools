# Agent 3 Scratch: Prework Sweep (M2 Issue Docs)

Status: pending

## Deliverable Checklist
- Scope: `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/issues/`
- Find all `## Prework Prompt (Agent Brief)` sections and resolve them (docs-only).
- Execution order (unblockers first):
  1. `LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-001` viz-key inventory format decision
  2. `LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-010` embellishment actual feature keys
  3. `LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-015` external usages of legacy mega-ops
- For each prompt:
  - Append “Prework Results (Resolved)” into Implementation Details.
  - Tighten acceptance/testing/deps if needed.
  - Commit A (findings), then remove the prompt and commit B.
- Do not reindex Narsil MCP; use `rg`, `git show`, and direct file reads.
