# Ecology Spike Scratch (Not Canonical)

This directory contains working notes, agent scratch pads, and historical planning artifacts created during the spike/feasibility/hardening workflow.

Implementation must **not** treat `_scratch/**` as a source of truth.

Canonical execution surfaces for Ecology alignment:
- Milestone plan (index): `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/milestones/M2-ecology-architecture-alignment.md`
- Local issue docs (execution slices): `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/issues/LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-*.md`

Canonical paper trail for background/evidence (still not “the plan”):
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/`
