# Ecology Domain Refactor — Phase 2 Modeling Spike (Pointer)

This “Phase 2 modeling spike” is captured in the canonical Ecology spike directory. This file is a thin navigation pointer to avoid duplicating content.

References:
- Plan: `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/ecology/ECOLOGY.md`
- Workflow: `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md`

## Modeling Outputs (Authoritative)

- Target interpretation (ecology-scoped reading of canonical architecture):
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/TARGET.md`
- Greenfield model (physics-first, maximal modularity):
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/GREENFIELD.md`
- Refactor target shape (behavior-preserving, modularization-first):
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/REFRACTOR-TARGET-SHAPE.md`
- Drift matrix (target invariant → current reality → evidence → refactor shape):
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/DRIFT.md`
- Spec-ready feasibility blueprint:
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/FEASIBILITY.md`
- Decision packets (remaining this-or-this choices):
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/DECISIONS/README.md`

## Required Canonical Docs Updates (Post-Implementation)

Any “promote to canonical docs” changes should be done alongside the actual refactor so docs remain truthful:
- `docs/system/libs/mapgen/reference/domains/ECOLOGY.md`
- `docs/system/libs/mapgen/reference/OPS-MODULE-CONTRACT.md` (if op/module guidance changes are needed)
