# Scratch: engine-refactor-v1 domain-refactor workflow inventory

This is a raw inventory of the active docs under:
`docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/`.

These docs contain a lot of “buried canon” (policies, guardrails, contract shapes),
but they are **workflow/project** docs, not the intended long-term canonical location.

## How to use this in the spike

- Treat these as **authority for intent** (especially where they reference locked ADRs/specs),
  but assume they are not in the final form for DX-first docs.
- Promote stable policy outcomes into `../SPIKE.md` (and eventually propose a home under `docs/system/libs/mapgen/**`).
