# Autogenerated doc path hits (MapGen keyword scan)

This file is intentionally “noisy”: it’s a raw list of docs that match keyword scans
(`mapgen`, domain names, etc.). Use it to avoid missing “buried canon”; promote the
actual curated sets + classifications into `docs-inventory.md` and `../SPIKE.md`.

## How to regenerate
From repo root:

```sh
rg -l -S "\bMapGen\b|\bmapgen\b|\bhydrology\b|\becology\b|\bmorphology\b|\bfoundation\b|\bplacement\b|\bnarrative\b|\brecipe\b|\bpipeline\b" docs --glob '!**/_archive/**' | sort
```
