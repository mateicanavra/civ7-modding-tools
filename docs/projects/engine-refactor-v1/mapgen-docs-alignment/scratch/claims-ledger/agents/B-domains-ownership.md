# Agent B — Domains + ownership (claims working sheet)

## Scope

Audit interpretive claims related to:
- which domains are canonical MapGen domains (Foundation/Morphology/Hydrology/Ecology/…),
- domain boundaries / ownership (MapGen vs Gameplay),
- standard recipe stages/steps naming and whether specific stages are “canonical”.

Hotspot: Narrative + Placement posture. If target authority says they dissolve into Gameplay or are forbidden/legacy, MapGen docs must not present them as canonical target posture.

Goal: produce **ledger rows** (not prose) that can be merged into `../CLAIMS-LEDGER.md`.

## Candidate rows

Add rows here in the same format as the ledger table:
- `claimId`
- `docPath`
- `quotedClaim`
- `claimType`
- `state`
- `anchors`
- `recommendedEdit`
- `notes`

## Preferred anchors

Target authority (what should be):
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/references/phase-2-modeling.md`

Canonical system docs (what we currently claim is canonical):
- `docs/system/libs/mapgen/reference/domains/**`
- `docs/system/libs/mapgen/reference/STANDARD-RECIPE.md`
