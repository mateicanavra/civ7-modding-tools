# M4 Stack Review Loop Plan (Agent IGNEZ)

## Scope
- Milestone: `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/milestones/M4-foundation-domain-axe-cutover.md`
- In-scope PRs/branches:
  - `#1344` / `codex/prr-m4-s07-lane-split-map-artifacts-rewire` (`LOCAL-TBD-PR-M4-004`)
  - `#1346` / `codex/prr-m4-s08-config-redesign-preset-retune` (`LOCAL-TBD-PR-M4-006`)
  - `#1347` / `codex/prr-m4-s09-docs-comments-schema-legacy-purge` (`LOCAL-TBD-PR-M4-006`)

## Rules
- No review branches; review/fix commits land on the reviewed work branch.
- Per-PR scratchpad is temporary and must be deleted after formalization.
- Shared review artifact: `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/reviews/REVIEW-M4-foundation-domain-axe-cutover.md`.
- Cross-cutting risks get mirrored into `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/triage.md` as `M4-review-loop` follow-ups.
