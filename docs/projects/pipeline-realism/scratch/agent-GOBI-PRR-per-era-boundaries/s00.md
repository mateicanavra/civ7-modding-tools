# Scratch Pad: Per-Era Boundaries + Builds Unblock

Owner: agent-GOBI-PRR
Start: 2026-02-07

This file is the running scratch pad for the implementation stack described in:
- `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/issues/ISSUE-per-era-boundary-segmentation-and-build-unblock-2026-02-07.md`

## Notes
- Keep entries short and concrete: what changed, why, commands run, and key outcomes.
- Prefer linking to `diag:dump` directories rather than pasting large tables inline.

## Timeline

### 2026-02-07
- Created issue doc + scratch pad as the working checklist.
