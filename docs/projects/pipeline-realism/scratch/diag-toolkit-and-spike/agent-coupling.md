# Scratch — Pipeline coupling plan

## Single causal spine posture

Foundation must publish:
- canonical crust truth (continuous fields + derived labels),
- history/provenance projections (era-indexed + rollups),
- plate/tectonic drivers (for belts + secondary shaping).

Morphology must consume:
- crust truth + provenance as the **primary** continent/basin structure,
- tectonic/belt drivers as modifiers (mountains, rugged coasts, island chains),
- noise as secondary flavor only.

## No-legacy rule

Any legacy independent “ocean basin separation” or other non-Foundation “truth” must be deleted or redefined as a derived post-process of Foundation truth.
