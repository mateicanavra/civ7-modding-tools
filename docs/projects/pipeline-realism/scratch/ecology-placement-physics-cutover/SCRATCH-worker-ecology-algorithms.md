# SCRATCH Worker A — Ecology Algorithms

## Ownership
- Slice: S2
- Branch: `codex/prr-epp-s2-ecology-physics-cutover`
- Focus: Remove fudge/gating composition and RNG in scoped ecology algorithms.

## Working Checklist
- [ ] Replace bandpass/ramp/penalty/bonus logic with physics-first scoring surfaces.
- [ ] Remove `minScore01` gating and RNG tie-breaks from ecology feature planners.
- [ ] Update contracts/config types accordingly.
- [ ] Update ecology tests and static no-fudge scan rules.

## Decision Log
- None yet.
