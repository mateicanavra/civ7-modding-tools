# SCRATCH Worker — `worker-epp-continuum`

## Session Start
- Session Start (ISO timestamp): `2026-02-15T01:19:48Z`
- Owned scope: `M4-T20..M4-T27` (`codex/prr-epp-s0` through `codex/prr-epp-s6`).

## Mini-Plan (next actions)
1. Load required skills: `pr-comments`, `git-worktrees`, `graphite` (optional `introspect`).
2. Review PRR EPP stack continuity, supersedence, and cross-branch contract carryover.
3. Extract unresolved reviewer concerns and deterministic guardrail gaps.
4. Produce per-task handoffs with evidence, residual risk, and recommended next action.

## Open Questions / Blockers
- None at kickoff.

## Handoff Log
- Pending.

## Session Start — Continuation
- Session Start (ISO timestamp): `2026-02-15T01:22:55Z`
- Mode: `read-only review` (scratchpad-only writes)
- Scope ownership: `M4-T20..M4-T27`

### Mini-Plan
1. Reconfirm Graphite/worktree/branch state and review constraints.
2. Read continuity anchors and derive review rubric.
3. Review each EPP branch (`s0`..`s6`) with PR comment context.
4. Produce per-branch handoff objects with evidence and residual risk.

### Progress Ledger
- `2026-02-15T01:22:55Z` — Started continuum review pass; constraints + plan captured.
- \ — Reviewed continuity anchors (M3 packet + execution plan + M3 milestone + blobular/mountains plan + 2026-02-14 cutover plan).
- [2026-02-15T01:23:35Z] Reviewed continuity anchors (M3 packet + execution plan + M3 milestone + blobular/mountains plan + 2026-02-14 cutover plan).
- [2026-02-15T01:27:57Z] Status-check handoff prepared: branch-by-branch review synthesized for s0..s6 (confidence tiered; no branch checkout/test reruns executed in this pass).
