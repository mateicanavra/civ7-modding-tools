- fixBranch: agent-TOMMY-M4-T27-fix-prr-epp-s6-hardening-docs-tests-4fee2c
- classification: Needs discussion
- workPR: #1267 (https://github.com/mateicanavra/civ7-modding-tools/pull/1267)
- PR comment summary: unresolved review threads = 0 (see continuation ledger: docs/projects/pipeline-realism/scratch/m4-ecology-placement-physics-continuum-fix-review/continuation-pr-comments.md)
- runtime-vs-viz: Hardening detects mismatch classes but inherits latent nonzero-upstream policy risk; runtime truth remains authoritative.
- evidence:
  - continuation manifest: docs/projects/pipeline-realism/scratch/m4-ecology-placement-physics-continuum-fix-review/continuation-manifest.tsv
  - review entry: docs/projects/pipeline-realism/reviews/REVIEW-M4-ecology-placement-physics-continuum.md
  - revalidation: n/a
- supersedence: 
- final recommendation: Hold implementation; decide permanent policy for nonzero maxUpstreamSteps (disallow vs support with strengthened invariants).
