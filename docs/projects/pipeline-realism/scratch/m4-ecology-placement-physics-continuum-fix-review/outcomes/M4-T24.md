# Outcome M4-T24

- task: M4-T24
- workBranch: codex/prr-epp-s3b-lakes-regression-fix
- fixBranch: agent-TOMMY-M4-T24-fix-prr-epp-s3b-lakes-regression-fix-08449d
- classification: Already tracked/superseded
- workPR: #1264 (https://github.com/mateicanavra/civ7-modding-tools/pull/1264)
- PR comment summary: unresolved review threads = 0 (see continuation ledger: docs/projects/pipeline-realism/scratch/m4-ecology-placement-physics-continuum-fix-review/continuation-pr-comments.md)
- runtime-vs-viz: Mitigation/algorithmic semantics are aligned at runtime; runtime truth remains authoritative.
- evidence:
  - continuation manifest: docs/projects/pipeline-realism/scratch/m4-ecology-placement-physics-continuum-fix-review/continuation-manifest.tsv
  - review entry: docs/projects/pipeline-realism/reviews/REVIEW-M4-ecology-placement-physics-continuum.md
  - revalidation: inherited-fixed-from-snapshot
- supersedence: Resolved via inherited snapshot/frontier semantics from agent-TOMMY-M4-T23-fix-prr-epp-s3-lakes-deterministic-2ad056 (validated by hydrology-plan-lakes tests).
- final recommendation: No additional code change on this branch; keep inherited T23 algorithm fix and retain regression coverage before enabling nonzero expansion broadly.
