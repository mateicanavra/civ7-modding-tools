# Triage — pipeline-realism

Unsequenced follow-ups and “we should do this later” work discovered while reconciling the proposal packets.

## Triage

- Follow-up (M1-001): Promote `artifact:foundation.tectonicHistory` (and `artifact:foundation.tectonicSegments` if canonical) to core tag constants to prevent stringly-typed drift in standard recipe contracts.
- Decision (M1-001): Use `artifact:foundation.plateMotion` as the canonical ID; `plateKinematics` remains a schema concept. New M1 artifacts carry `version: 1` while legacy artifacts stay unversioned until their owning issues update producers.
