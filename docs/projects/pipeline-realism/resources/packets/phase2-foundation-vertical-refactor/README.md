# Packet: Phase-2 Foundation vertical refactor (pointer)

This packet is a pointer to the Phase-2 “model-first / contracts-first” Foundation refactor docs. They are relevant as **migration mechanics** and contract discipline, but they are not (by themselves) a basaltic-lid evolutionary physics spec.

Representative docs:
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/foundation/spike-foundation-current-state.md`
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/foundation/spike-foundation-modeling.md`
