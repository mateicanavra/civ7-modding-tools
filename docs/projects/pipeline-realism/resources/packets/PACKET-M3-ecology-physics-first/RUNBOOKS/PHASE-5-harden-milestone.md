# Runbook: Phase 5 (Harden Milestone)

## Goal

Make every milestone item executable:
- acceptance criteria are verifiable
- commands/gates are explicit
- there are no hidden "and then figure it out" steps

## Inputs / Sources of Truth

- Milestone:
  - `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/milestones/M3-ecology-physics-first-feature-planning.md`
- Packet (authority):
  - `../EXECUTION-PLAN.md`

## Outputs

- Milestone reads like an index and points to:
  - local issue docs for implementation detail
  - packet docs for authority

## Agent Assignments (Phase 5)

- GATES agent: propose the minimal deterministic + no-fudging gate set.
- Orchestrator: integrate; keep scope stable (harden, don't expand).

## Gates

- Every milestone acceptance criterion has:
  - a command
  - an expected result

## Do Not Do

- Do not change the milestone scope; only clarify and make it executable.
