# Runbook: Phase 0 (Context + Anchors)

## Goal

Re-anchor the execution work in `pipeline-realism` and establish the M3 packet as the execution authority.

## Inputs / Sources of Truth

- Project home: `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/`
- M2 milestone (architecture alignment, behavior-preserving):
  - `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/milestones/M2-ecology-architecture-alignment.md`
- M2 issue corpus:
  - `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/issues/LOCAL-TBD-PR-M2-*.md`
- Engine-refactor-v1 ecology spike directory is evidence-only:
  - `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/ecology-arch-alignment/`

## Outputs

- Packet directory exists: `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/resources/packets/PACKET-M3-ecology-physics-first/`
- `README.md` and `VISION.md` exist.
- Orchestrator scratch exists: `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/scratch/ORCH-M3-ecology.md`

## Agent Assignments (Phase 0)

- Orchestrator: ensure the packet exists and is the authority.
- ARCH/SCORE/PLAN/VIZ/GATES agents should only start after `VISION.md` exists.

## Gates

- Everyone can answer:
  - What is M2?
  - What is M3?
  - What is the no-fudging posture?
  - Where is the packet?
  - Where do decisions live?

## Do Not Do

- Do not treat engine-refactor-v1 milestones as the execution project.
- Do not write new plan docs outside the packet except the milestone/issues that the packet generates.
