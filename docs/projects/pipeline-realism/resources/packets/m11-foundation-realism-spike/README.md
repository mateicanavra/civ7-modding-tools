# Packet: M11 Foundation realism spike (pointer)

This packet is a pointer to the **M11 “Foundation realism” spike set**, which lives in the `engine-refactor-v1` project and is used as a key source/guardrail set for pipeline-realism planning.

Primary docs:
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/spike-foundation-realism-gaps.md`
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/spike-foundation-realism-open-questions-alternatives.md`

Companion deep dives:
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/foundation-realism/`

Notes:
- These docs are strongly coupled to the current Foundation implementation and are best treated as **audit + observability + guardrails** for a larger evolutionary refactor.
