# Research

Short, scannable evidence memos that support decision packets under `../decisions/`.

Each memo should include:
- pointers into proposal docs (path + heading)
- mapping to current contract/code (as referenced from `docs/system/libs/mapgen/reference/domains/FOUNDATION.md`)
- hardening/observability concepts worth carrying forward (and whether they already exist)
