# Decisions

Decision packets for synthesizing the two target-model proposals into one canonical architecture for the Foundation evolutionary refactor.

- Use the decision packet template: `~/.codex-rawr/skills/architecture/assets/decision-packet.md`
- Each decision packet should resolve one “this-or-this” ambiguity and update the canonical SPEC later.
