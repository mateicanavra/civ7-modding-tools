# Decisions

Decision packets for synthesizing the two target-model proposals into one canonical architecture for the Foundation evolutionary refactor.

- Use the decision packet template: `~/.codex-rawr/skills/architecture/assets/decision-packet.md`
- Each decision packet should resolve one “this-or-this” ambiguity and update the canonical SPEC later.

## Draft Defaults (Chosen So Far)

- D01: `d01-ordering-crust-vs-plates.md`
- D02: `d02-forcing-mantle-minimum.md`
- D04: `d04-evolution-semantics-history-model.md`

## Remaining

- D03, D05, D06, D07, D08, D09 (see the backlog in `docs/projects/pipeline-realism/resources/spec/proposal-comparison-foundation-evolutionary-refactor.md`)
