# PRR Evidence Index (agent-GOBI)

This directory is the durable, repo-tracked evidence bundle for the Pipeline Realism remediation stack.

Evidence files (in stack order):
- `s00.md`: Phase 0 no-shadow + execution runbook readiness
- `s10.md`: Phase A (Foundation truth non-degenerate)
- `s20.md`: Phase B (landmask grounded in crust truth) + numeric gate
- `s21.md`: Phase B erosion connectivity (no hidden reclassification)
- `s30.md`: Phase C belts as modifiers (positive-intensity diffusion seeding)
- `s40.md`: Phase D observability enforcement
- `s90.md`: Final legacy + docs cleanup sweep
