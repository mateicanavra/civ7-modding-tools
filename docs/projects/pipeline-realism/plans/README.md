# pipeline-realism plans

This directory intentionally has a single canonical execution plan. Everything else that can be mistaken as "the plan" is archived.

## ACTIVE (Canonical)

These are the only docs in this directory that should be treated as the current execution plan:

- Canonical plan: `PLAN-no-legacy-foundation-morphology-refactor-2026-02-05.md`
- Alias pointer (stable entrypoint): `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-no-legacy-foundation-morphology.md`

## Reference (keep)

These are supporting references (spike/SPEC/decisions/milestone). They are not execution plans:

- Spike diagnosis (spec vs code truth): `../resources/research/SPIKE-m1-foundation-realism-regression-2026-02-04.md`
- Spike packet pointer: `../resources/packets/m11-foundation-realism-spike/README.md`
- Canonical SPEC: `../resources/spec/foundation-evolutionary-physics-SPEC.md`
- Decisions index: `../resources/decisions/README.md`
- Milestone: `../milestones/M1-foundation-maximal-cutover.md`

## Archived (superseded)

Moved into `plans/_archive/` to avoid posture/execution confusion:

- `PLAN-m1-realism-remediation.md` -> `_archive/PLAN-m1-realism-remediation.md`
- `2026-02-04-finish-the-spec-wave.md` -> `_archive/2026-02-04-finish-the-spec-wave.md`
- `2026-02-04-implementation-readiness-report.md` -> `_archive/2026-02-04-implementation-readiness-report.md`
- `2026-02-04-spec-to-implementation-pack.md` -> `_archive/2026-02-04-spec-to-implementation-pack.md`
- `preflight-context-2026-02-06.md` -> `_archive/preflight-context-2026-02-06.md`
