# MapGen reference

## Purpose

Reference pages define contracts precisely (APIs, schemas, invariants, and key vocabulary).

## Audience

- Developers implementing or reviewing SDK/pipeline changes.
- Tooling and documentation authors.
- AI agents extracting canonical contracts.

## Contract references

Planned canonical references (built in later slices):

- Glossary (terms + ID prefixes)
- Run boundary (target `RunSettings`, current mapping to `Env`)
- Recipe schema (RecipeV2)
- Stage/step authoring contract
- Config compilation vs plan compilation
- Tags and registries
- Artifacts (and mutation posture)
- Ops module contract
- Observability (run IDs, tracing, reproducibility)
- Visualization (deck.gl posture + routing)
- Adapter capabilities
- Studio integration seam
- Standard recipe contract
- Domain contracts (Foundation/Morphology/Hydrology/Ecology/Placement/Narrative)
