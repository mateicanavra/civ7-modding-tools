# MapGen explanation

## Purpose

Explanation pages help you understand the system: architecture, rationale, and mental models.

Explanation pages should link down to reference/policies — not the other way around.

## Audience

- Developers onboarding to MapGen architecture.
- Authors/tooling maintainers who need to understand “why”.

## Explanation topics

Planned canonical explanation pages (built in later slices):

- System architecture + ownership boundaries
- Pipeline model (truth vs projection)
- Why config compilation is separate from plan compilation
- Determinism + reproducibility
- Mutation model (artifacts vs fields/buffers)
- Narrative status (target contract + current wiring status)
- Studio as a reference consumer (not architecture authority)
