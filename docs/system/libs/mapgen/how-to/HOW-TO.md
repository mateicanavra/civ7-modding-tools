# MapGen how-to guides

## Purpose

How-to guides are task-oriented.
They assume you already understand the basics and want to accomplish a specific task quickly.

## Audience

- Developers extending MapGen or integrating it into apps/workers.
- Authors making new knobs/presets (where supported).

## Task list

Planned canonical how-tos (built in later slices):

- Run a recipe headless
- Integrate the MapGen Studio worker
- Add a stage / step / op contract
- Add an artifact / tag
- Add a knob / preset
- Visualize pipeline (deck.gl): `docs/system/libs/mapgen/how-to/visualize-pipeline-deckgl.md`
- Debug with trace and visualization (deck.gl)
