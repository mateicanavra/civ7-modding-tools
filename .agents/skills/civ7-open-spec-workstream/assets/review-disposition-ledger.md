| | P1/P2/P3 | | | authority/product/boundary/shortcut/verification/downstream/other | accepted/rejected/invalidated/user-decision/waived/deferred | | | yes/no |

## Disposition Rules

- `accepted`: repair before dependent implementation or closure.
- `rejected`: record source evidence showing the finding does not apply.
- `invalidated`: record later source evidence that made the finding false.
- `user-decision`: record the user or authority decision that resolves the finding.
- `waived`: allowed only for P3/nonblocking findings; record risk, owner, and trigger.
- `deferred`: allowed only for P3/nonblocking findings; record destination, owner, and context.

No material finding may remain undispositioned at phase closure.
